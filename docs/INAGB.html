<h1>Outline/Purpose</h1>
To provide a simple and easy to use budgeting system that allows money to be
assigned to categories that constitute an area of expense.

For every category of spending there is a corrasponding envelope. This ensure
that money can be set aside for that type of spending.

Accounts can be added to represent accounts existing in the real world to ensure
checks can be made to ensure everything is accounted for.

The system will also allow credit card spending and debt to contribute to total
available funds.

Accounts will assign expenses to a category this then removes this money from
the envelope.

Income can be slipt in to different sources and added to accounts when received

At the beginning of each budget cycle an amount is specified for each envelope and
these funds are taken from the pool of income and dispersed to the envelopes.

The user has the option of dispersing every dollar proportionally or simply specify
the amounts assigned to the envelopes the former dispersing every doller in the pool.

Credit cards provide 0 income and any amount withdrawn from the card is considered
a debt and subtracted from the net avaiable funds. Money can be transfered to a
credit card to remove the debt. This would represent a credit card payment in the
real world.
